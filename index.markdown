I’m a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) student at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>, graduating in 2027. In my first semester, I’m taking <i>Machine Learning</i> with Prof. <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Benjamin Marlin</a>, along with two PhD‑level courses - <i>Trustworthy and Responsible AI</i> with Prof. <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Eugene Bagdasarian</a>, and <i>Research Methods/Empirical CS</i> with Prof. <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">David Jensen</a>. 
<p>
</p>
Before UMass, I worked as a Software Developer II at  <a href="https://home.barclays/">Barclays Bank PLC</a>, building a financial operating reporting tool for internal business users, where I primarily used PL/SQL, Python, Autosys, and UNIX to generate business‑critical reports. 
<p>
</p>
I earned my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai (<a href="https://tsec.edu/">TSEC</a>) and completed internships at <a href="https://takeuforward.org/">Takeuforward</a> (data structures & algorithms) and <a href="https://globocom.info/">Globocom</a> (web development). I also authored a Springer‑published paper on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-1111-6_20">image captioning with emoji prediction</a>. 
<p>
</p>
My focus now is on advancing AI research and actively seeking opportunities to create intelligent systems that deliver measurable, real‑world impact.
