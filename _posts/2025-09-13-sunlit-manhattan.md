> New York City had always been on my list â€” fast, crowded, yet full of moments that make you stop and take it all in.

**Morning â€” Central Park**

The day started at Central Park. It was big, green, and full of life â€” joggers, cyclists, and families out for walks. A few people were playing baseball on the open fields, and near Bethesda Terrace, others were playing chess on the stone tables. I instantly recognized the spot from John Wick, which made it even more interesting to see in person. The lake nearby had people rowing boats, and it felt peaceful despite being right in the middle of the city.

**Late Morning â€” Fifth Avenue and Times Square**

After spending some time in the park, I walked down Fifth Avenue. The street was full of energy â€” live music, performers, and stores of all the big fashion brands lined up one after another.

Soon, the crowd grew thicker, and the lights got brighter â€” I had reached Times Square. It was everything you expect from it: massive LED screens flashing nonstop, people taking photos everywhere, and street artists doing their thing. I grabbed a quick snack from a food cart and just stood there for a bit, taking it all in.

**Afternoon â€” The Subway, Wall Street, World Trade Center, and Battery Park**

After walking for hours, I decided to take the NYC subway for the first time. It was noisy, packed, and moved fast â€” but thatâ€™s New York for you.

At Wall Street, the Charging Bull was surrounded by tourists taking pictures. A short walk later, I reached the World Trade Center. Seeing it in person was something else â€” the One World Observatory looked stunning against the sky, and the 9/11 Memorial nearby was quiet and powerful at the same time.

From there, I headed to Battery Park, where things finally slowed down a bit. The view of the Statue of Liberty across the water was worth every step.

**Evening â€” Brooklyn Bridge**

As the sun started to set, I made my way to the Brooklyn Bridge. The walk across was easily one of the highlights of the day. The view of the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline with the evening lights was incredible. By the time I reached Brooklyn, the city was glowing, and it felt like the perfect way to wrap up the trip.

**Reflections**

It was exhausting, but every part of it was worth it, from Central Parkâ€™s calm to Times Squareâ€™s chaos.

I still missed a few places this time, but that just means one thing that
`Iâ€™ll be visiting again soon`.
