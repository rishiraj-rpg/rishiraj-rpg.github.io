I’m a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) student at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>, graduating in 2027. In my first semester, I’m taking two PhD‑level courses - <i>Trustworthy and Responsible AI</i> with Prof. <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~eugene/">Eugene Bagdasarian</a>, and <i>Advanced Natural Language Processing</i> with Prof. <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/directory/brendan-oconnor">Brendan O'Connor
</a> along with <i>Systems for Data Science</i>(masters level) with Prof. <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/directory/peter-klemperer">Peter Klemperer</a>.  
<p>

Before UMass, I worked as a Software Developer II at  <a href="https://home.barclays/">Barclays Bank PLC</a>, building a financial operating reporting tool for internal business users, where I primarily used PL/SQL, Python, Autosys, and UNIX to generate business‑critical reports.

I earned my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai (<a href="https://tsec.edu/">TSEC</a>) and completed internships at <a href="https://takeuforward.org/">Takeuforward</a> (data structures & algorithms) and <a href="https://globocom.info/">Globocom</a> (web development). I also authored a Springer‑published paper on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-1111-6_20">image captioning with emoji prediction</a>.

Outside of my academic and professional work, I’ve always been passionate about sports, <i>especially cricket</i>. I’ve represented my school in the prestigious Giles Shield tournament, my undergraduate college in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14RkH_oZbSGyWp19hTdSTcZ1A-ALVpzqd/view?usp=sharing">inter‑college</a> cricket, as well as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15h9yQa0NJaGdLl5TruxIGY4XyyOXrOrc/view">Barclays Pune</a> official cricket team in corporate tournaments. I also enjoy <i>hiking</i>, both for the challenge and the opportunity to explore new terrains.
